## TUPLES ###

# Tuples are different from lists in two aspects, the syntax of declaration and
# the fact
# that a tuples nor its items cannot be modified after the declaration
# since a tuple is immutable, python can optimize it, making it faster than a
# default list
default_tuple = (1, 2, 3, True)

print(type(default_tuple))
